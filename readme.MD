# Speak to HAL9000.

## HAL has various predetermined questions you can ask him. The problem is, you don't have the manual.

# How to use:
## HAL cannot process entire strings, so enter a series of hexadecimal characters (1-0, A-F) to receive multiple answers to each assigned question.

# The engineers that created HAL are a little crass. Be aware that he will not take to every question kindly.
