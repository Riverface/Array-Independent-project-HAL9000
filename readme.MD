## Speak to HAL9000.

### HAL has various predetermined questions you can ask him. The problem is, you don't have the manual.

## How to use:
### HAL cannot process entire strings, so enter a series of hexadecimal characters (1-0, A-F) to receive an answer.

# Ok, so here's what it actually is.

## The program:
* breaks the string down into an array of numbers split() by spaces, then checks each part of the array for numbers.
  * The array then returns predetermined responses in a range from 0 to the number entered as an upper limit.
  * There are easter egg responses for hexadecimal alphanumeric characters separated by spaces as well. A few of them change depending on how many times you have entered them.
